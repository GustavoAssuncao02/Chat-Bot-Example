Here is an example of a chatbot made with Python using TensorFlow. This chatbot utilized a 15-year database of all comments made on Reddit, totaling 1.7 trillion comments. You can interact with the chatbot and receive responses in various languages. This chatbot example was created for training purposes, so the responses may be funny and somewhat unexpected.

It is possible to integrate it with WhatsApp and other communication platforms. I will provide a step-by-step guide on how to use the chatbot below. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
